**UniqueGraph**

UniqueGraph is a Python class designed to analyze and visualize directed graphs with unique properties. This class allows users to input directed graph data, ensuring uniqueness, and performs checks for reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity before generating and displaying the graph visualization.

**Features:**

Data Input: Accepts directed graph data from the user, ensuring uniqueness of values.
Property Checks: Validates the input graph for reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.
Graph Visualization: Generates a visual representation of the graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.

**Usage:**

Instantiate the UniqueGraph class.
Input directed graph data when prompted.
The class will perform property checks and generate the graph visualization if conditions are met.

**Dependencies:**

networkx: For creating and manipulating complex networks.
matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the graph data.
